Rails 4.1 Boilerplate
=============


This is my preferred flavor. 

Using: Rspec, PostgreSQL, Twitter Bootstrap 3 RC1, and HAML. 

No Turbolinks. No Coffeescript.


Rename application with [Rename tool](https://github.com/morshedalam/rename).

Magically renaming project to SweetNewName:

    $ rails g rename:app_to SweetNewName
